# DEV

* work in progress ;-)
* Make sure b5 env export does not fail on non-string lists (skipping these lists now)
* Fix os.getlogin() not working on Ubuntu

# 1.0.2

* Support for specifying the necessary b5 version in config.yml
* More work on documentation

# 1.0.0

* First real release for PyPI
* 1.0! ;-)
* A lot of new and restructured documentation

# 0.13.3

* Provide ENV inside template rendering (`{{ env.SOMETHING }}`)

# 0.13.2

* Fixed docker:is_running not returning the right state

# 0.13.1

* Fixed docker:container_run not handling --user correctly
* Updated PyYAML to at least 3.13 (Python 3.7 compatibility - without beta package)

# 0.13.0

* Python 3.7 compatibility (PyYAML 3.13b1 - still not stable, but working)

# 0.12.2

* Throw error when docker_compose_config_overrides and docker_compose_config_override is mixed together, this will
  minimize usage errors due to updated projects but not updated local configs
* git-init now allows you to specify the branch to use for new projects
* git-init will clone using the SSH URL by default

# 0.12.1

* b5-init now calls "b5 project:init" instead of "b5 init" for project initialization (reduces headaches)

# 0.12.0

* b5-init readded, this allows you to create new projects using predefined skeletons (aka "templates")
* "basic" template is provided by https://git.team23.de/build/b5-skel-basic

# 0.11.10

* Added docker:command:â€¦ shortcut for running commands inside docker (see `commands` configuration
  option)
* Handle keyboard interups in a better way, not showing failed task

# v0.11.9

* export B5_STATE_FILE for access to STATE_FILE in subshells and similar
* pipenv not uses right environment even on pipenv:install/update
* docker_compose_config_overrides added to allow multiple overrides
  (will replace docker_compose_config_override, currently just a warning is shown)

# v0.11.8

* Use "docker-compose build --pull", so newer versions of images are always pulled upon build
* Serialize boolean values as 0/1 for bash

# v0.11.7

* Fixed docker exec not keeping the stream open, so shell execution breaks

# v0.11.6

* b5 now uses Pipfile for dependency management, using pipenv
* pipenv module added, including some documentation
  - pipenv module includes pyenv support to install a particular python version, independent
    of the system version
* We now recommend using pipenv over virtualenv

# v0.11.5

* Added a note about additional dependencies to README.md
* Added meta information to template rendering, so templates may include something like:  

```php
<?php

/*
 * Template generated file, DO NOT EDIT.
 *
 * Original source: {{ meta.template_file }}
 * Generated: {{ meta.now }}
 */

actual_php_code();
```

# v0.11.4

* docker:container_run now uses "docker exec" instead of "docker-compose exec" when the
  container is already running. "docker-compose exec" is broken.
* Updated docker documentation to use "halt" instead of "stop"

# v0.11.3

* Pull images ob docker:install
* Write b5 error messages to stderr
* More robust docker:container_run

# v0.11.2

* Removed template module debug output
* Note to myself: No more late releases

# v0.11.1

* Support for config.local.yml added (should be preferred over local.yml)
* Sorry, docs for v0.11 already stated to use config.local.yml, which was not true :/

# v0.11

* Error handling working as expected again (one failing command will make b5 stop further execution)
* Template module added (see https://git.team23.de/build/b5/blob/master/docs/modules/template.md)
* composer:update will now do a "composer install", as this is the right way to go here
* docker:
  - module is ready to be used
  - docker_compose_configs and docker_compose_config_override added  
    (see https://git.team23.de/build/b5-docker-traefik for usage example)
  - docker:is_running added, might be used inside the Taskfile to handle running
    state differently
  - docker:container_run will now use `docker-compose exec` if container is already
    running
* in general $module:run will no longer do a forced path switch, this will simplify usage

# v0.9.0 to v0.10.5

* FIRST version of python based b5 implementation
* License added, MIT/BSD
* Eat your own dog food: b5 now uses b5 for development/build tasks
* Worked on documentation
* legacy module added:  throws a warning and needs to be enabled explicitly
  - necessary to support b5_legacy module loading (`b5:module_load`)
* Better error handling
* New modules: virtualenv, npm, composer and docker (beta)
